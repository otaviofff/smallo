# Smallo Library

Smallo is a Big-O notation library in Java. 

It contains several classic algorithms, which are often taught to students, as 
part of their Computer Science course, at universities around the world. Smallo 
then serves an academic purpose, and aims at illustrating classes that can be 
overwhelmingly theoretical. Smallo's code can be debugged, in a step-by-step 
manner, in order to facilitate the understanding of these algorithms, and the 
time complexity they experience.

## Algorithms

Smallo has grouped algorithms into the following groups:
1. Math: Factorial, Fibonacci
2. Search: Binary, Linear
3. Shuffle: Fisher-Yates
4. Sort: BogoSort, BubbleSort, InsertionSort, MergeSort, QuickSort, SelectionSort
